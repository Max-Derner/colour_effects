This a a project to develop a Python PyPI package that not just handles colour text output but can also apply sweet colour effects to your text.

# Working on this?
Don't use Windows, install Python 3.9, then use `source ./tooling && venv-setup` to get yourself a venv set up with Python 3.9 (our lowest supported Python version)

Use command `lint-cfx` to lint work, and command `test-cfx` to test work.

Use a branch in your name to do feature work, then submit a pull request.
